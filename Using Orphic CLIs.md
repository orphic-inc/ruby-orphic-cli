## Using Orphic CLIs

Generally an outcome is expected, but for testing purposes isn't necessary (similar to how a disconnect message may be unexpected). Jools are the result of a successful Tudio session which will connect two endpoints with any (capable) number of events in memory. With a jool, these events will be compiled into a displayable canvas that today would be expressed with a web page, but could be transfered into a holographic physicality when specified. In its lieu, Orphic recommends an .SVG or similar file to represent the jools logo, icon, or related photography.

# spools

A spool can be most likened to a volume or book in that threads make up pages, where a spool can ascertain specific locations where Geeks were infantized, using the Paji and Cursor Geeks respectively. Paji specifies for uncommon keywords or commands you may not yet be familiar with, but has been identified as a Cursor Geek by Flash. Flash assists with real-time rendering and ephemeral changes. This creates a perpetual system via [Relational and Non-Relational databases](https://medium.com/@zhenwu93/relational-vs-non-relational-databases-8336870da8bc), as seen in our [example mongoDb doc](https://github.com/orphic-inc/ruby-orphic-cli/blob/main/orphic/lib/orphic/cli/sprites/cursor.rb).

# Threads

For each Geek, several inputs could be throughput as-is included with the example Geek. The reason "disc" or the equivalent of a hard-reset/disco is highly recommended, but not required falls on a few reasons:

The map command provides access to infinite tiers of districts, within reason unless things break which is cause to believe unreasonable in scope.

While a mechanism for invoking scope and difference of equation from the original scope of a project (or "District"), custom Districts can invoke their own commands via this CLI which can create interesting effects with APIs.

# Districts

To create a District, it is required to have an accessible (via SSL and redirected to SSL) API ([Example](https://tudio.us/api/auth)) which returns a [valid](https://jwt.io/introduction) [JWT]([More Info]), and Orphic Enterprises provides base districts for [these factors](https://12factor.net/):

# Sprites

Sprites serve as directional input, whether intentional or unintentional, serving a focal point for where all attention has become interest with a beginning state of (0,0).

The names of many things in this project are literal and figurative as a means of remaining as removed as possible from advantageous or disadventageous means of exploration, and Sprites are where this will be seen most obviously. Setting an initial compass as stated above, a project begins with declaring short or broad in scope. This could be compared to a `switch` statement:

`Ruby || Golang = Cursor/Geek || Paji/Flash`

// TODO

## Geek: Declarative

### I - Awake - Infant: Codebase
##### Goal: Spin up a spool.
```trial by fire```
#### II - Growth - Child: Dependencies
##### Goal: Add threads to a spool.
```Plugin/extension/dongle```
#### III - Discovery - Adolescent: Config
##### Goal: Decipher Threads.
```convert to code or ffmpeg handles```

## Flash: Maximum Portability

### IV - Trust - Rookie: Backing Services
##### Goal: Create cipher, private API.
``` like artdevelapp.com or artdevel.app or wuu.bi or spenser.tv or orphic.sh```

#### V - Truth - Amateur: Build, Release, Run
##### Goal: Compare spool.
```If my writing utensil (e.g. pen) doesn't accomplish the same task, what is different with my Geek and/or spool?```
#### VI - Magic - Associate: Processes
##### Goal: Accomplish task
```git GameStock```
## Paji: Continuous Deployment

### VII - Poetry - Professional: Port Binding
```https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/system-parameters```
##### Goal: All art is derivative, lest ye revert.
#### VIII - Drive - Master: Concurrency
##### Goal: Container creation, canvas management.
#### IX - Will - Legend: Disposability
##### Goal: Specializations, attributes.

## Cursor: Scale Up

### X - Loyal - Penultimate: Dev/Prod Parity
##### Goal: "Battle" Geeks, "winning" is relative.
```Survival instincts, necessities of life```
#### XI - Enthusiasm - Ultimate: Logs
##### Goal: Analysis, statistics.
#### XII - Clarity - Awesome: Maximum Portability
##### Goal: Drawing the screen, public/productions.
```Sets the physical stage```
